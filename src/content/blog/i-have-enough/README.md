> The times where I was actually nice to people are over, from now I do me. I have enough of spending nights and weekends just to fix somebody's mistakes because I had no balls to stand for my opinion and expertise, trusting people who try to sound smart but they actually do not know what they are talking about, architects starting systems from microservices and other horrible players in this industry. I thought issue lands in place but in times where people larping software engineer title pretending to know what to do I choose to not be developer or even be associated with them at all.

[WIP: Small emotional rant about sad times in software industry, the lost of craftmanship, grit and determination to build things that actually work.]
